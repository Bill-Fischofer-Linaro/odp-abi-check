This is a set of scripts to maintain ABI compatibility database visible at
https://linaro.github.io/odp-abi-check/timeline/ODP/ . Travis CI cron builds
will automatically update, build and publish both build cache and generated
timeline.

However to stop it from rebuilding last releases on and on it might be useful
to update remote branches manually. To do so, run `./remote-update.sh` script,
passing the name of git remote as first argument. If you use `origin`, there
is no need to pass anything, it will be picked up automatically.
